# Front-end session â€” 2025-09-07

Purpose: Add presenter and audience views, wire slide controls to the agent, and enable emoji reactions with a QR onboarding flow.

What changed

- Presenter controls
  - File: `src/views/PresenterView.tsx`
  - Listens to `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` and provides Prev/Next buttons.
  - Calls `agent.stub.prevSlide()` / `agent.stub.nextSlide()`.
  - Displays a QR code linking to `/audience`.

- Audience reactions
  - File: `src/views/AudienceView.tsx`
  - Renders emojis from `state.availableReactions`.
  - On tap, calls `agent.stub.storeReaction(emoji)` with simple sent feedback.

- QR code component
  - File: `src/components/QRCode.tsx`
  - Lightweight QR via an image service (no new deps). Can swap to a local generator later.

- Minimal routing
  - File: `src/App.tsx`
  - Renders `AudienceView` on path `/audience`; otherwise renders `PresenterView` (e.g., `/` or `/presenter`).

- Agent updates
  - File: `worker/agents/presentation.ts`
  - Added `prevSlide()` callable and guarded index from going below 0.
  - `onStart` ensures `slide_reactions` table exists.
  - `storeReaction(reaction)` persists reactions tied to the current slide.

Build/verification

- `npm run build` completed successfully; both SSR and client outputs built.

Follow-ups (optional)

- Show live reaction counts on the Presenter view.
- Replace QR service with local QR generation to avoid network dependency.
- Add a `/presenter` alias route and/or visual slide content.

User prompts (verbatim)

1. I have an application here I am going to use for a conference talk. I need two different views. The first one I need is the presenter view. The presenter will use a clicker to move things forward or backward using right arrow, left arrow. The current setup in src/App.tsx shows how to advance the slide using the backend agent. I also want a front-end client that audience members will use from their phone. They will have emojis shown to them, and clicking them calls the function storeReaction on the agent and passes the emoji. On the agent we will store reactions per slide.  I'll need the phone people to scan a QR code, so I think I'll need a specific separate URL.
2. I like to keep track of what gets created by AI. Can you create me a folder called truth-window and then add a session markdown document that keeps track of what we did, this would be front-end-20250907.md
3. Yeah I'd like to put my prompts in there too educationally, can you add that
