# Front-end session — 2025-09-09

## Summary of changes
- Added live reaction counters per slide, opt-in via `showLiveReactions` slide meta.
- Extended `PresentationState` with `reactionCounts` and `showLiveReactions`.
- Agent now refreshes counts on slide changes and after each `storeReaction()` insert.
- Presenter view shows counters when enabled for the current slide.
- Updated slide meta types and template; enabled on `04-pride.mdx` for demo.

## What/Why/Where
- What: Display real-time emoji -> count totals for selected slides.
- Why: Let the presenter see audience feedback live on stage.
- Where:
  - `worker/agents/presentation.ts`: new state fields; updated `setSlide()` and `storeReaction()`; added `_countsForSlide()`.
  - `src/views/PresenterView.tsx`: render counters and pass meta flag to `setSlide()`.
  - `src/slides/index.tsx`: added `showLiveReactions` to `SlideMeta`.
  - `src/slides/_template.mdx`: documented meta usage.
  - `src/slides/04-pride.mdx`: enabled `showLiveReactions`.

## Notable implementation details
- Counts are derived from `slide_reactions` via `SELECT reaction, COUNT(*) ... GROUP BY reaction` and merged with the slide’s `availableReactions` to include zeroes.
- Agent pushes updated `reactionCounts` after each reaction insert when live mode is enabled; presenter subscribes via `useAgent`.
- `setSlide(index, reactions, showLiveReactions)` refreshes counts atomically with slide changes.

## Verification steps
1. Start dev server (`npm run dev`).
2. Open presenter view (`/`), navigate to the "Pride" slide.
3. Open audience view (`/audience`) on another device.
4. Tap the provided emojis; counts increment live above the QR code on the presenter.
5. Navigate away from a live slide; counters hide.

## User prompts (verbatim)
> I would like to allow some slides to show realtime reactions. The agent would need to know when it switches slides that it should update the state with an emoji to count map. I want to show that on the presenter view. Maybe it's a meta property?
