# Front-end work — 2025-09-09

## Summary of changes
- Added LocalStorage persistence for audience reactions keyed by slide index and emoji.
- Created an audience results page at `/audience/results` that aggregates reactions and suggests links based on top reactions and optional per-slide emoji rules.
- Wired routing to include the new results view.
- Removed the inline "View your results" link from the audience screen (navigation to results happens at the end).

## What / Why / Where
- What: Store per-slide emoji counts locally so each audience member can view personalized results and follow-up links at the end of the talk.
- Why: Enable a lightweight, privacy-friendly way to tailor post-talk actions without extra backend dependencies.
- Where:
  - `src/views/AudienceView.tsx`: Records `{ [slideIndex]: { [emoji]: count } }` to LocalStorage under `audience_reactions` on each tap. Adds a small link to navigate to results.
  - `src/views/AudienceResultsView.tsx`: New page reading LocalStorage, showing per-slide breakdown and links based on the most-selected reaction and per-slide rules.
  - `src/App.tsx`: Routes `/audience/results` to the new view.

## Notable implementation details
- Data shape in LocalStorage: `Record<string, Record<string, number>>` mapping slide index → emoji → count.
- The results page exposes a simple `LINKS_BY_EMOJI` map for global per-emoji links and `LINKS_BY_SLIDE_EMOJI` for targeted per-slide rules (e.g., slide 4 + 🙋 → https://aiavenue.show).
- No server changes required; worker/agent continues to store canonical reactions in SQLite for aggregate analysis.

## Verification steps
1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Open `/audience`, tap several emojis across different slides; navigate presenter to change slides and continue.
3. Navigate to `/audience/results` and confirm:
   - The “Top signal” and total reaction count reflect taps made.
   - Per-slide breakdown lists counts by emoji.
   - Suggested links render for the top overall reaction.
4. Click “Reset” to clear LocalStorage and confirm the results page updates accordingly.

## User prompts (verbatim)
> As the audience submits reactions can you store them by slide number and count of emoji in LocalStorage? I'd like to be able to have them go to a final page/slide that shows different links based on what was answered.
