# Front-end Session ‚Äì 2025-10-27

## Summary of changes
- Prevent presenter navigation lockups by treating audio playback errors as completed fragments and allowing shift-held navigation to bypass audio fragments (`src/views/PresenterView.tsx`).
- Surface a running total of üçÖ reactions from the agent and display ‚ÄúX üçÖs were thrown‚Äù on the final slide (`worker/agents/presentation.ts`, `src/views/PresenterView.tsx`, `src/components/TomatoSummary.tsx`, `src/slides/19-thank-you.mdx`).
- Add slide verification script and npm runner to enforce matching `audioTransitions`/`handActions` arrays across MDX slides (`scripts/verify-slides.mjs`, `package.json`).
- Extend slide verification to assert referenced audio/background assets exist under `public/`, flag images below a 1920√ó1080 recommendation, and resize backgrounds (including `marvi-inspiring.jpg`) with `sips` so checks now pass.

- Centralized audio completion through a shared `finish()` handler wired to `ended`, `error`, and `play()` rejection to keep fragment progress in sync with failed clips, plus shift-aware navigation that skips fragment playback (while updating progress) when the presenter needs to jump instantly.
- Presenter view now provides slide components with aggregated data via a context provider so the thank-you slide can render the total tomato count text while staying reusable.
- Verification script walks non-underscored MDX files, evaluates `meta` objects in a VM, and reports mismatched or invalid audio/hand arrays before exiting non-zero.
- Asset checks ignore remote/data URLs, guard against path traversal outside `public/`, decode PNG/JPEG headers directly for dimensions, and we normalized background assets to 1920-px width (or 1080 height) with macOS `sips`.

## Verification
- `npm run build`
- `npm run verify:slides`

## User prompts (verbatim)
```
I had a situation on slide 11 where the audio didn't play but the movement did. I was unable to move forward. Things are there.
Great it was actually slide 14
Awesome can we maybe make an npm command that verifies all slides are okay. want to make sure we have the same number of hand actions and audio transitions.
Awesome let's update the truth-window with your changes
Can we verify that the audio file exists and the background image does too
What is the ideal size of the background image so it fills the screen in the current setup
Is it possible to run through the slides and figure out which background images need to be resized?
Let's make a commit
Can you use sips to fix the wrong sized images?
Can you do the marvi-inspiring.jpg one please
If holding down shift make it skip transitions
Is it possible to show the number of üçÖ that were shown across all reactions on the last slide, but in the text. X üçÖs were thrown
```
