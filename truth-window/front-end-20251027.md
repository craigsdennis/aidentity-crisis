# Front-end Session – 2025-10-27

## Summary of changes
- Prevent presenter navigation lockups by treating audio playback errors as completed fragments (`src/views/PresenterView.tsx`).
- Add slide verification script and npm runner to enforce matching `audioTransitions`/`handActions` arrays across MDX slides (`scripts/verify-slides.mjs`, `package.json`).
- Extend slide verification to assert referenced audio/background assets exist under `public/` and flag images below a 1920×1080 recommendation.

## Notable implementation details
- Centralized audio completion through a shared `finish()` handler wired to `ended`, `error`, and `play()` rejection to keep fragment progress in sync with failed clips.
- Verification script walks non-underscored MDX files, evaluates `meta` objects in a VM, and reports mismatched or invalid audio/hand arrays before exiting non-zero.
- Asset checks ignore remote/data URLs, guard against path traversal outside `public/`, decode PNG/JPEG headers directly for dimensions, and warn when either edge is under 1920×1080.

## Verification
- `npm run build`
- `npm run verify:slides` *(fails: reports undersized backgrounds, see command output)*

## User prompts (verbatim)
```
I had a situation on slide 11 where the audio didn't play but the movement did. I was unable to move forward. Things are there.
Great it was actually slide 14
Awesome can we maybe make an npm command that verifies all slides are okay. want to make sure we have the same number of hand actions and audio transitions.
Awesome let's update the truth-window with your changes
Can we verify that the audio file exists and the background image does too
What is the ideal size of the background image so it fills the screen in the current setup
Is it possible to run through the slides and figure out which background images need to be resized?
Let's make a commit
```
