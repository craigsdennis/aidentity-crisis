# Slide manipulation — 2025-09-09

## Summary of changes
- Added live reaction counters per slide, opt-in via `showLiveReactions` slide meta.
- Extended `PresentationState` with `reactionCounts` and `showLiveReactions`.
- Agent now refreshes counts on slide changes and after each `storeReaction()` insert.
- Presenter view shows counters when enabled for the current slide.
- Updated slide meta types and template; enabled on `04-pride.mdx` for demo.
- Presenter: added PageUp/PageDown support for slide navigation.
- Presenter: added per-slide audio transitions (fragment-like) that play clips on Next/Prev before changing slides.

## What/Why/Where
 - What: Display real-time emoji -> count totals for selected slides; add audio transition steps per slide.
 - Why: Let the presenter see audience feedback live and orchestrate timed audio cues inline with slide navigation.
  - Where:
  - `worker/agents/presentation.ts`: new state fields; updated `setSlide()` and `storeReaction()`; added `_countsForSlide()`.
  - `src/views/PresenterView.tsx`: render counters, pass meta flag to `setSlide()`, handle Arrow/Page keys, and implement audio transitions (tracking per-slide progress, playback, and reverse).
  - `src/slides/index.tsx`: added `showLiveReactions` and `audioTransitions` to `SlideMeta`.
  - `src/slides/_template.mdx`: documented meta usage including `audioTransitions` with examples.
  - `src/slides/04-pride.mdx`: enabled `showLiveReactions`.

## Notable implementation details
- Counts are derived from `slide_reactions` via `SELECT reaction, COUNT(*) ... GROUP BY reaction` and merged with the slide’s `availableReactions` to include zeroes.
- Agent pushes updated `reactionCounts` after each reaction insert when live mode is enabled; presenter subscribes via `useAgent`.
- `setSlide(index, reactions, showLiveReactions)` refreshes counts atomically with slide changes.
 - Audio transitions:
   - Each slide can define `audioTransitions: string[]` (paths under `/public`).
   - Presenter tracks `audioProgress[slideIndex]` (number of clips already consumed).
   - Next: if `progress < clips.length` play `clips[progress]` and then increment progress; else advance slide.
   - Prev: if `progress > 0` play `clips[progress - 1]` and then decrement; else move to previous slide and set its progress to its last clip count.
   - While audio is playing, additional navigation is ignored to prevent overlap.

## Verification steps
1. Start dev server (`npm run dev`).
2. Open presenter view (`/`), navigate to the "Pride" slide.
3. Open audience view (`/audience`) on another device.
4. Tap the provided emojis; counts increment live above the QR code on the presenter.
5. Navigate away from a live slide; counters hide.
6. Use a clicker or keyboard PageUp/PageDown to go prev/next; default browser scroll is prevented.
7. Add `audioTransitions` to a slide meta (e.g., two mp3s under `/public/audio/`).
8. In presenter view: press Next — first clip plays; press Next again — second clip plays; press Next again — slide advances. Press Prev — second clip plays backward; press Prev again — first clip plays; press Prev again — previous slide shown.

## User prompts (verbatim)
> I would like to allow some slides to show realtime reactions. The agent would need to know when it switches slides that it should update the state with an emoji to count map. I want to show that on the presenter view. Maybe it's a meta property?

> Can we make the slides respect a clicker looks like it's "Page Up" "Page Down"

> I want to add the ability to have slides define if they have audio transitions. Like I want to click next and if there is audio it plays that before it plays the audio, then the next forward click, plays the next one, and then if there is no audio left for that it goes forward. Also enable back to follow the same. The audio will be mp3 files in the public directory.
