# Front-end session â€“ 2025-09-19

## Summary of changes
- Surface slide titles (with lightweight markdown support) in the audience experience.
- Extend agent state/setters so titles travel with reaction configuration updates.
- Capture the slide title in the audience view and render it above the reaction grid.

## Implementation details
- Added an optional `title` field to `PresentationState.currentSlide` and updated `setSlide()` to accept an options object with `showLiveReactions` and `title`.
- Presenter view now passes the slide meta title (or `null`) whenever it syncs the agent for the initial slide and while navigating between slides.
- Created `MarkdownText` helper to sanitize + render headings/inline emphasis, then used it in the audience view to show the current slide title.

## Verification
- `npm run build`
  - Note: Wrangler emitted a sandboxed log-write warning (`EPERM` to `~/Library/Preferences/.wrangler`) but the build artifacts completed successfully.

## User prompts (verbatim)
- "I want to make the audience view see the title of the slide. The title might be markdown."
- "Yeah log and commit please"
